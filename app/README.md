# FlightLine

FlightLine is a small web app that is intended to be a lightweight alternative to NotauScore - the sofware that supports NotauMatic devices used for scoring F3A and Pattern contests.

It is specifically created to allow for the results to be downloaded by Score! (the application used for scoring IMAC competitions).

FlightLine's aim is to (eventually) also support other devices such as Peter Vogel's iOS based Electronic Scribe app as well as ScorePad written by Dan Carroll.

If you would like to contribute, your help would be most welcome.  Apart from help developing the code, we also need people to test, document and collaborate on ideas for the future.

### What's New

We're just starting out but FlightLine is mature enough that I've already been able to run a competition with it.   The current focus is on making the setup easier and adding features necessary for the smooth operation of a competition.
